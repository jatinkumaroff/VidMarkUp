# VidMarkUp

VidMarkUp is a simple full-stack video annotation app where you can play a video, capture frames, draw or add text on top of it, and save those annotations with timestamps. Markers appear on the timeline so you can quickly jump back to important moments with thumbnail previews.

Built using React (Vite) on the frontend and Node.js + Express on the backend. Media uploads and thumbnail generation are handled server-side, and annotation data is stored using a lightweight JSON database.

Tech stack: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, Multer, Sharp, lowdb, Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, Git/GitHub.
